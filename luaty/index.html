<h3><a href="https://github.com/gnois/luaty">Luaty</a></h3>
<p>Luaty is an indent sensitive language with partial type inference that compiles to Lua.</p>


<a name="overview" class="anchor"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Luaty stands for <strong><em>Lua</em></strong> with more or less <strong><em>ty</em></strong>ping. <em>Typing</em> has two meanings here, both are the features of Luaty:</p>

<h4>Type inference</h4>
<p>Luaty type checker statically infers variable types and warns when they are used inconsistently in the code. Although it is impossible to correctly and fully infer all variable types, some warnings are quite helpful in uncovering common coding mistakes or typos.</p>

<h4>Type less</h4>
<p>Due to offside syntax, Luaty could use less syntax boilerplate than Lua. <code>end, do, then</code> are removed without causing ambiguity. Luaty codes appear shorter and cleaner, yet maintains straightforward mapping to its Lua counterpart.</p>

That said, Luaty strives to limit its syntactic changes. Lua language is already very well designed, so the rule of thumb is that, if something can be achieved by introducing a function, it should not be a syntactic feature of Luaty.
That means Lua users can be productive with Luaty in an afternoon, and Lua code can be hand converted into Luaty easily using a Find/Replace editor.

<p>In short, it boils down to: we type check, you type less</p>
<!--
<ul>
  <li>no more end</li>
  <li>no more do after for and while</li>
  <li>no more then after if</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some syntax changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>repeat becomes do</li>
<li>elseif becomes else if</li>
<li>local becomes var</li>
<li>[[ and ]] become backquote(s) ` that can be repeated multiple times</li>
<li>table keys can be string or keyword</li>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Luaty only requires LuaJIT to run.</p>

<p>With LuaJIT in your path, clone the Luaty repo, and cd into it.</p>

<a name="indentation" class="anchor"></a>
<h3>Indent rules</h3>

<ol>
<li>Either tabs or spaces can be used as indent, but not both in a single file.</li>

<li>Comments have no indent rule.</li>

<li>Blocks such as if, for, while, do and lambda expression -> can have child statement(s).</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A single child statement may choose to stay at the same line as its parent</li>
    <li>Multiple child statements must start at an indented newline</li>
  </ul>

<li>A table constructor or function call can be indented, but the line having its closing brace/parenthesis must realign back to its starting indent level.</li>

<li>A semicolon ; is used to terminate single-lined function if it causes ambiguity when used in a list of expressions.</li>

</ol>
